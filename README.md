# Transformer GPT:
gpt.py: To train the transformer architecture on Tiny shakespeare (input.txt) data. This is exact replica of what Andrej Karpathy's Work. 
To run this file, Run: Python3 gpt.py # This will Start the Traing process.
Infrence file is to simple run the trained model that you will get after running the gpt.py. Command to run this file: Python3  gpt_infrence.py
stream file is the Web UI version of Infrence file. To run this: steamlit run stream.py

# Reformer GPT:
reformer.py: To train a reformer architecture on Tiny shakespeare (input.txt) data. This is my work. For sureving, how well reformer architectures can do over transformers.
To run reformer.py, Run Python3 reformer.py # This will start the Training Process.
Infrence file is to simple run the trained model that you will get after running the gpt.py. Command to run this file: Python3  infrence_reform.py
stream file is the Web UI version of Infrence file. To run this: steamlit run stream-reformer.py
